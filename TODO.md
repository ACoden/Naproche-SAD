## TODO ##

# Admin #

* systematic runs of "test" examples

* Isabelle-specific build (optional)

* semi-automated distribution builds for Linux, macOS, Windows
  (e.g. appveyor, travis)


# Misc #

* move provers/provers.dat to toplevel directory (no executables there) (??)

* make $SPASS_HOME/SPASS from Isabelle actually work (!?)


# General #

* clarify project / program name: "Alice" vs. "Naproche" vs. "ForTheL"

* stay-resident server instead of command-line batch-tool (??)

* caching of old results from prefix of source, old versions etc. (??)

* parallel checking: internal and/or external provers (??)

* support for multiple (simultaneous) input files (??)

* more robust / scalable library handling (imports) (!?)

* clarify error handling in Main, e.g. for stay-resident server
  with multiple running requests, see also
